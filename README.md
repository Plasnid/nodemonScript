# nodemonScript
In the previous repo, our script ran only once.  To make it run, we had to manually call it with node, or use a task runner.  If we were working on that script and wanted to know about errors as we coded and saved, it would be a little extra work.

To work this example we type the following into the terminal:

_npm run run_hot_js_

This will ask nodemon to keep an eye on the script and rerun it whenever it changes!
